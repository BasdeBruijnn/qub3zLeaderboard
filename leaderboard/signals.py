        The model class.
    - instances
        The actual instance being saved.
    - created
        A boolean; True if a new record was created.
    - raw
        A boolean; True if the model is saved exactly as presented (i.e. when loading
        a fixture). One should not query/modify other records in the database as the
        database might not be in a consistent state yet.
    - using
        The database alias being used.
    - update_fields
        The set of fields to update as passed to Model.save(), or None if update_fields
